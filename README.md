# python_kata

This repo is intended for use on Python code kata.
It is meant to improve coding aptitude in Python
by repeatedly doing/coding each task being asked for
in a unittest script. Eventually, by doing this over
and over, you will come up with new and better ways
of solving a certain problem. 

This indeed is what I am aiming for in creating this
repo. I'll appreciate any thoughts/suggestions that
you can give me.
